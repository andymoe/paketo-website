# Where Do Buildpacks Factor In

In the above example you used `pack` and a `builder`. A builder is an image comprised of three things
* All of the buildpacks that are used by the builder
* Default groups buildpacks and the order in which they run in that group
* The base image your application is built on top of

All buildpacks in the builder can be overridden by the user.

If say you wanted to use a new version of the Paketo `node-engine-cnb`, you could simply download the latest release from [github](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/node-engine-cnb/releases) and override a buildpack used in the builder

```
pack build test-drive -p <path/to/application/root> --builder gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/builder:base --buildpack <path/to/new/buildpack.tgz>
```

Currently the Paketo-Buildpacks project releases the following builders

* gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/builder:full-cf
* gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/builder:base
* gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/builder:tiny
